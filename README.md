# About

Hashmap implemention in C, based on how [PHP 7 implemented it's HashTable](https://nikic.github.io/2014/12/22/PHPs-new-hashtable-implementation.html)

# Compiling

Written in plain vanilla C (and using bstrlib for sane string handling), this library can be compiled with just:

```
make
```

## Running tests

Make is also used to run the unit tests, written with minunit:

```
make check
```
